					<b>Summary:</b> During the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a UX Design Intern for Microsoft under the Web Experience Collective. My work was concentrated around the modernization of the Start feed and bringing innovation to the Start app.

			<h1>Reflection</h1>
			<p>During my internship, I helped to drive feed modernization efforts on the mobile canvas. Below are a few different opportunities that I leveraged throughout my internship:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I learned how to define and align work streams across both designer and developer teams.</li>
				<li>I contributed to designs sprints that centered around innovation on the mobile canvas.</li>
				<li>I conducted and analyzed user research in order to inform my design decisions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Overall, this internship was an amazing period of growth for me as a designer. I learned not only about the design process as a whole, but also about cross-discipline collaboration, telling a narrative through design, and most importantly about how to balance functionality with creating an enjoyable experience for the user. This internship opened my eyes to the fact that, while functionality is king in UX, designers shouldn't lose focus on the opportunities to provide small moments of delight to brighten the user's day.</p>
