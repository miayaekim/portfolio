			<u>Role</u>: Student designer </br>
			<u>Date</u>: Spring 2021 </br>
			<u>Summary</u>: This app was created as a final project for DSGN-234: Art of the Web. Students were instructed to create any app that they would find to be helpful. I worked on the design, prototype, and presentation of this app over the course of 2 weeks.

		<div class="subheader">PROBLEM</div>
		<div class="divider"></div>
		<div class="body-paragraph"><u>Identifying the Problem</u>: Considering the student as the target user, I identified the need for an easy way for students to connect with collegiate student tutors. Although teaching assistants are present in the majority of difficult classes, oftentimes the amount of office hours is insufficient to support a class of hundreds of students. </br> </br>
		<u>Research</u>: I interviewed Valerie Wrenn—the Associate Director of Tutoring at the Weingarten Learning Resources Center. Wrenn emphasized that there is a need to centralize the pre-existing tutoring resources that Weingarten provides. Currently, administrative staff waste several hours each week due to issues with working with several different softwares to schedule tutoring, communicate with tutors, and log tutor work hours. An app that centralizes this information would not only save time, but also make the tutoring center accessible to more students. </div>

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<div class="body-paragraph"><u>Iteration 1</u>: The first iteration focused on wireframing and establishing the overall look and feel of the app. The aesthetic of the app draws inspiration from academia; the black and beige color scheme reflects the appearance of text on paper. In terms of wireframing, the app’s functionality was centered around connecting the students with the tutors—allowing the students to request and maintain the contacts of tutors they frequented. However, this focus was later adjusted in the second iteration.</div>

		<div class="body-paragraph"><u>Iteration 2</u>: The second and final iteration refined the design by adjusting the navigation and features. Given that student tutors hired through university tutoring centers are not always able to be consistently paired with certain tutees, the design was altered to reflect this fact—instead focusing on prioritizing easy access to tutoring schedules and sign-up. Tutoring schedules are featured on the homepage of the app and a button to the sign-up form (which is handled by a third-party software) is clearly visible. This iteration also implements both a student and tutor view and increases the legibility of the design by adding customizable colors. All of these elements were then prototyped in Figma. </br> </br>
